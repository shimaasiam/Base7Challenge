# Base7Challenge
As long your main concern is the manual testing, creating test cases and spot defects that make me focus on them and let you check my ideas and way of thinking in the system business
The automation tool is new for me, it is not difficult , I already learn as much as serving my testing and task through online videos but practically I didn’t reach to the structure that I wished
I was planning to divide the automation suites to:
  1. common features like “login”, “logout” and reuse these test cases as tear up and tear down
  2. configuration file contain variables to allow data to be dynamic and not repeatable
  3. common test cases like success reservation for each room type and reuse it in testing the reservation page data validations 
  4. creating the testcases that need automation 
But I spend a lot of time trying with the tool and failed
